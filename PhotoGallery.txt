Confluence of Alaknanda (background) and Mandakini (foreground) at Rudraprayag. In the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, after the Mandakini ravaged its banks, all the structures below the Chamundi temple have been seriously damaged and the large boulder called Narad Shila has disappeared while a long line of stones have appeared along the confluence.
