Many of the newer buildings and particularly the Sangam (confluence) area was severely damaged in the 2013 Uttarakhand floods. A footbridge over the Mandakini river, and also a road bridge 6 km downstream at Raitoli was washed away. The layout of the Sangam has altered significantly. The road along the Mandakini valley, leading to Kedarnath, was damaged at many points.
